Starting the Analyst Notebook
-----------------------------------

For the Analyst notebook to be functional, it needs to start side-by-side with the database and the IUI (ISAAC user interface).
To do so, the recommended method is to use the remote docker images, as:

	./scripts/docker/run.sh --no-mast -analyst --no-sim -remote
